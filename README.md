  Multi-label classification has recently demonstrated promising performance through CLIP-based unsupervised learning. However, existing CLIP-based approaches primarily focus on object-centric features, which limits their ability to capture rich contextual dependencies between objects and their surrounding scenes. In addition, the vision transformer architecture of CLIP exhibits a bias toward the most prominent object, often failing to recognize small or less conspicuous objects precisely. To address these limitations, we propose Background-Aware CLIP-GCN (BAC-GCN), a novel framework that explicitly models class-background interactions and is designed to capture fine-grained visual patterns of small objects effectively. BAC-GCN is composed of three key components: (i) a Similarity Kernel that extracts patch-level local features for each category (i.e., class and background), (ii) a CLIP-GCN that captures relational dependencies between local-global and class-background features, and (iii) a Re-Training for Small Objects (ReSO) strategy that enhances the representation of small and hard-to-learn objects by learning their distinctive visual characteristics. Therefore, our method facilitates a deeper understanding of complex visual contexts, enabling the model to make decisions by leveraging diverse visual cues and their contextual relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BAC-GCN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark multi-label datasets: VOC07, COCO, and NUS, validating the effectiveness of our approach.
